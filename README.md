## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project uses Terraform to set up an AWS S3 bucket as a static website host. It automatically uploads your HTML, CSS, and image files to the bucket and makes them publicly accessible.  

So basically: write your website â†’ run Terraform â†’ your site is live. ðŸš€

- Terraform (v1.3+ recommended)
